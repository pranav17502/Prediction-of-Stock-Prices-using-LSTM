# Prediction-of-Stock-Prices-using-LSTM

### Problem Statement
To predict the volatility of intraday stock market considering various parameters.

### Approach to the problem
* Live Data Collection using yfinance Library
* Pre processing the data for drawing insights in terms of stability of the company
* Visualizing the stock price of the company right from the date of listing till present graphically
* Developing a Model using LSTM( Type of Recurrent Neural Network)

### Need for this Model
Stock market price prediction is a difficult undertaking that generally requires a lot of human-computer interaction. Traditional batch processing methods cannot be used effectively for stock market analysis due to the linked nature of stock prices. We present an online learning technique that employs a recurrent neural network of some sort (RNN) called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), which uses stochastic gradient descent to update the weights for individual data points. When compared to existing stock price prediction systems, this will yield more accurate results. With varying sizes of data, the network is trained and evaluated for accuracy, and the results are tallied. A comparison with respect to accuracy is then performed against an Artificial Neural Network
